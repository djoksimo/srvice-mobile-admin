2. Run `yarn install` inside the srvice-mobile-admin repository
3. Run `react-native link`

What have we achieved, where are we and where are we going? 🚀

We are student-based and just getting started but we have high hopes

Srvice aims to provide the perfect opportunity for service businesses to evolve with the digitalization of the business world.
How?
For Businesses:

Srvice aims to help service businesses increase their awareness to customers through our platform. Primarily through our disruptive matching process which allows more service inquiries, resulting in increased potential for business transactions.

We allow businesses to increase teir growth with little to no capital.

Srvice aims to help digitalize other business operations in one central platform (scheduling, employee management, estimates, rates, quotes, payment, reviews, etc.)
For Consumers:

Srvice aims to redesign the process of selecting, and booking services by making the process quick and easy.

With verified services providers so you know who you're doing business with, and a disruptive matching system, Srvice allows you to find, schedule, and pay for a new haircut, car repair appointment or any other service.
How we work 💪
We stay active in the Srvice Slack Workspace and ask questions constantly!
We check our Trello boards to view project management updates
We assign ourselves to tickets and set goals based on how long we think each sprint/ticket might take
We design our prototypes in Figma and export them in Zeplin
We ask questions and post solutions to any issues in our internal Stack Overflow and we document stuff in Slite (the platform that you're on right now).
Our GitHub repos are available here. You're welcome to look through our entire codebase but please don't share anything outside of Srvice without written permission 🤫
Each repository should have a wiki that can be seen in GitHub or it can be found in srvice.slite.com
